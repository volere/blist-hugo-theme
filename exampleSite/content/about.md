I am a self-taught developer and arborist. I write about small business, tech, and the trades.
I have honed my organizational and problem-solving skills to adeptly manage resources, time, and personnel. As a technical small business owner I have experience in managing network infrastructure, and troubleshooting technical issues,. I implement custom tailored solutions for mine and various businesses.
